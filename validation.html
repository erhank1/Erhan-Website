        <h1>Written Reflection or Log including Evidence of ‘Site Validation’ </h1>
        <p>I have able to make a website from scratch,  with the help of Adrian and Kamil I have able to create my very first website.</p>
        <p>  I have looked couple of websites to inspire me from the beginning however they were all complicated and very sophisticated when visiting it for the first time.</p>
        <p> So I have made my website simple and easy to use for the visitors that would have no difficult when surfing through the webpages. </p>
          <p>  I have used couple of features that renntechmercedes.com used on their website however I have changed it to use of another things for e.g. they used a newsletter form for the visitor fill it in and put just text information of the contact details, I have done reverse of that I have used contact form instead of newsletter. I have also put a map of the location where we are, they have used full width of it but I have used that suited the website layout.</p>
           <p>     Then I have used validator though W3C and able to fix the issues.</p>
